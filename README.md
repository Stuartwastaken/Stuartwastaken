# 🛠 Experience

### <a href="https://mesh-local.com">Mesh</a> - Co-Founder, CEO
- 🤝 Designed and implemented Mesh, (12,000 users), a real-time social connectivity app for people moving to a new city who want to establish a community.
- 🌐 Engineered 250+ unique cloud functions in TypeScript for features like geo-based recommendations and ai algorithms for optimally pairing 4 people together in person at local coffee shops.


#### Starlink Constellation Visualizer — C++ & WebGL

A C++17 engine that simulates 9,636 Starlink satellites across 5 orbital shells using Keplerian mechanics, then visualizes the full constellation, packet routing, and satellite handoff scheduling in the browser.
